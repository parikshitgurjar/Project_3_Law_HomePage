### There are lot of things which i learn by doing this Project.

>Getting a better Understanding of Aligning different type of Elements like image,text or child container etc.

1. <b>Center Align Elements : </b> <br/>
    - To horizontally center a block element (like < div >), use margin: auto;
    - Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
    - Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
    - The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins :
    ![image](./images/readme_image1.jpg)
    Code :-
    
      ```
      .center
      {
        margin: auto;
        width: 50%;
        border: 3px solid green;
        padding: 10px;    
      }
      ```
2. To just center the <b>text</b> inside an element, use <b>text-align: center;</b>

3. Center an <b>Image</b> : To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element: <br>
      - Code :<br>
        ```
          img 
          {
          display: block;
          margin-left: auto;
          margin-right: auto;
          width: 40%;
          }
          ```

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
